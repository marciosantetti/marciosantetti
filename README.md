I am an Assistant Professor of Economics in the [Marlboro Institute for Liberal Arts & Interdisciplinary Studies](https://emerson.edu/academics/schools-labs-and-centers/marlboro-institute) at [Emerson College](https://www.emerson.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) in 2022.

My main research field is applied Macroeconomics, and I have publlished 
on the environmental effects of technological change, the effects of (residential) investment on business cycles, and on the structural determinants of
the falling labor share in the US economy.

I have experience in teaching Statistics, Econometrics, Macro/Microeconomic Theory, Forecasting, and Introductory Economics courses.
