Hello! I'm Marcio Santetti. 

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). My main research field is applied Macroeconomics, and I have publlished 
on the environmental effects of technological change, the effects of (residential) investment on business cycles, and on the structural determinants of
the falling labor share in the US economy.

I have been working as full instructor at the University of Utah since 2018, having taught Econometrics, Probability \& Statistical Inference, and Intermediate
Microeconomics courses.

I am also a [Gracie Jiu-Jitsu](https://www.gracieuniversity.com/) Blue Belt, and love music, exercising, and cooking.
